Magna Life Settlements, Inc. is a leading life settlement provider licensed wherever state insurance regulations require, and able to do business in every state.  We pay people for life insurance policies they either no longer need or no longer want.  Many people have no idea just how valuable their life insurance policy is when they surrender or lapse it, and so many policies today are just given up because of inability to pay the premiums.  If you fit our criteria you may be able to receive real value for something you felt had become a burden.

Most of the people we deal with are seniors who need funds for retirement or medical expenses.  A transaction with Magna is highly regulated for maximum consumer awareness, transparency and protection. Our team will be glad to answer your questions as you decide what to do with your policy.
